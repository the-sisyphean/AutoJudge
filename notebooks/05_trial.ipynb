until it changed to rontgenium rg in  num  these heavy elements are very unstable and have only been synthesized in a few laboratories you have just been hired by one of these labs to optimize the algorithms used in simulations for example when simulating complicated chemical reactions it is important to keep track of how many particles there are and this is done by counting connected components in a graph currently the lab has some python code see attachments that takes an undirected graph and outputs the number of connected components as you can see this code is based on everyones favourite data structure union find num  after looking at the code for a while you notice that it actually has a bug in it the code still gives correct answers but the bug could cause it to run inefficiently your task is to construct a graph with a given number of vertices and edges where the code runs very slowly we will count how many times the third line the one inside the while loop is visited and your program will get a score according to this number the input consists of one line with two integers n and m the number of vertices and edges your graph should have apart from the sample there will be only one test case with n =  num  and m =  num the output consists of m lines where the i th contains two integers u i and v i  num  ≤ u i v i ≤ n this indicates that the vertices u i and v i are connected with an edge in your graph   \n","1

songs must be the best songs however you quickly realize that this approach is flawed even if all songs of the album are equally good the early songs are more likely to be listened to more often than

are equal you expect that their play frequencies should follow zipfs law zipfs law is an empirical law originally formulated about word frequencies in natural languages but it has been observed that many natural phenomena such as population sizes and incomes approximately follow the same law it predicts that the relative frequency of the i th most common object in this case a song should be proportional to  num  i to illustrate this in our setting suppose we have an album where all songs are equally good then by zipfs law you expect that the first song is listened to twice as often as the second song and more generally that the first song is listened to i times as often as the i th song when some songs are better than others those will be listened to more often than predicted by zipfs law and those are the songs your program should select as the good songs specifically suppose that song i has been played f i times but that zipfs law predicts that it would have been played z i times then you define the quality of song i to be q i = f i z i your software should select the songs with the highest values of q i the first line of input contains two integers n and m  num  \\u2264

sometimes actually most of the time you can figure out the answer to a quiz question just by looking at the alternatives being a low budget show the underpaid quiz question authors strive to minimize their effort in coming up with the alternatives for each question they construct each alternative by making a small number of changes to the correct answer where a change consists of replacing one part of the correct answer with something else for example transforming green blue stripes into green yellow stripes has one single change while changing the same answer into life universe stripes has two changes the question authors never permute the parts so order matters in other words transforming green blue stripes into stripes blue green has two changes even though they are both technically the same answer note that the answers are case sensitive so green blue stripes and green blue stripes need  num  changes your task is to write a program that automatically finds the most likely answers to questions constructed in this way define the incongruousity of an alternative as the maximum number of changes needed to transform that alternative into any of the other alternatives we

parts are strings of letters a-z and a-z digits  num - num  and spaces each part doesnt contain leading or trailing spaces except the space after a comma that separates  num  parts the maximal length of a part is  num  characters output the alternative that requires the smallest maximum amount of changes to be turned into any other answer if there are several least incongruous alternatives output
