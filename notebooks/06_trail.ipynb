give two integers  a  and  b   and ask if you write out  m  and  l  in binary  are  m s bits in the  inclusive  range   a b   equal to  l s bits in the same range  toadette responds yes or no  give an integer  x   and ask is the  x th bit of  m  or  l  greater  toadette responds with mario  luigi  or equal  however  toadette is afraid that her answers to questions of the first type gives you too much information  so she decides to make things interesting  each time you ask a question of the first type  she will lie to you  independently and randomly  with probability   frac 1  13    can you

central new york have decided that they have had enough of modern society  and want to move from there  together they have bought a rectangular piece of land far away  and will now settle there  the land consists of  n  times m  squares  and it is possible to build a maximum of one house on a given square  each square has value  a  x y   that describes how nice it is  on a scale between  0  and  100   the goal of the eccentrics is to get as far away as possible from everyone else  including each other  the happiness an eccentric experiences from building his house on square   x y   is thus  a  x y  cdot d   where  d  is the smallest distance to another person  out of habit  the eccentrics use manhattan distance to measure this   d  is defined as   min  x   x 2     y   y 2   over all other peoples squares   x 2  y 2    the eccentrics now want your help in placing their houses optimally  so that the sum of the happiness they experience is as high as possible  can you help them  the input consists of  10  test cases  which are described below  print  k  lines with the positions of the houses  each line should contain two numbers  first the row for the house  between  1  and  n    then the column  between  1  and  m    two houses may not be placed at the same position</td>\n","      <td>hard</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>1313</td>\n","      <td>244</td>\n","    </tr>\n","

the  x th bit of  m  or  l  greater  toadette responds with mario  luigi  or equal  however  toadette is afraid that her answers to questions of the first type gives you too much information  so she decides to make things interesting  each time you ask a question of the first type  she will lie to you  independently and randomly  with probability   frac 1  13    can you find out whose number is

pocket to its parent has a length of  y  i  feet  one of the tree leaves contains the motherlode  and each other ore pocket contains  x  i  dollars worth of ore  pete begins at the mine entrance  and his goal is to reach the motherlode  obviously  pete cannot travel to pocket  i  until all  y  i  feet of dirt in the tunnel leading to it has been removed  but once a tunnel has been completely excavated  pete can travel that tunnel  in both directions  as many times as he wants  pete explores the mines by repeatedly performing the following steps  in order  pete chooses a tunnel that he can reach from his current location  and that has not yet been fully excavated  pete digs through one foot of the chosen tunnel  this costs him one dollar  if the tunnel is now completely clear  pete travels through the tunnel to the newly opened pocket and mines the ore  if that pocket contains the motherlode  then he stops exploring the mine  otherwise  he sells the ore in that pocket for  x  i  dollars and continues exploring  note that the tunnel pete chooses to dig in the first step of each round of digging does not need to be adjacent to his current location  so long as pete can reach the tunnel by traveling through the mine along a sequence of completely excavated tunnels  he can also choose a different tunnel each round  even if the tunnel he was digging in the previous round is not yet completely excavated  if pete ends a round of digging with no money  and without having reached the motherlode  the mining operation is a bust and pete goes home bankrupt  pete has surveyed the geology of the area and knows the mine layout  as well as the amount of ore in each chamber  but hasnt yet decided on a strategy for how to dig the tunnels  he knows that in addition to any riches he earns from the mine itself  he will need some amount of startup money in order to reach the motherlode  and so he is courting investors  he wants to present them with two pieces of information  the minimum number of dollars  a  that pete must begin with in order for his venture to be successful even in the worst case  for it to be guaranteed that he reaches the motherlode no matter how he chooses the tunnel to excavate during each round of digging  the minimum number of dollars  b  that pete must begin with in order to reach the motherlode in the best case scenario where pete chooses tunnels optimally  this information will allow the investors to decide how much to fund pete  based on how much they trust him to dig optimally without making any mistakes  given the mine layout

survived  and eventually the two bears made a couple and got many small and cute polar bear cubs  unlike polar bears  human scientists would probably not survive falling into the arctic waters  and they would have to compensate the lack of bear fur using intelligently written software to run on their pdas  which can help them avoid stepping on smaller  and therefore more dangerous  ice floes than necessary  the scientists already have software and hardware to download high resolution up to date satellite photos of the area they will be in  and to transform the downloaded pictures into two dimensional polygons describing the shapes of the ice floes  you have been asked to write the software that given these descriptions  and the positions of the scientists  calculates the area of the smallest ice floe any of the scientists need to pass  including the ice floes the scientists are already standing on  so that they can meet  the scientists can only jump between two ice floes if they are closer to each other than some distance  d   actually  it is possible to jump between two floes if there exists one pair of points  one on each ice floe  on the surfaces or borders of the floes  that are not farther away from each other than the distance  d   even though the ice floes are floating around in the water  the relative positions of the ice floes can be considered constant during

effective in attack  besides mastering such powerful trick  each of them also knows how to defend against exactly one ball trick  therefore  one of their popular training routines is to let two players play against each other  one using a trick and the other trying to defend against it  we call this a move  the one who uses a trick is called an attacker  and the other is called a defender  rbs team can perform sequences of moves  to state it more concisely  we use the notation    text  attacker    text  defender    to represent a move  suppose the current move is    texttt a    texttt b     a performs the only trick he knows  if a attacks successfully  i e   b fails to defend   the next move will normally be    texttt a    texttt c    for some other player c  however  if it is the third consecutive time a attacks successfully  a will have to take a rest for the next two moves and the next move will be    texttt c    texttt d    for some other players c and d  if a fails  i e   b defends successfully   the next move will be    texttt b    texttt c    for some other player c  note that in all cases  a  b  c  and d must be pairwise distinct players  in addition  c and d must not be at rest for the next move  today  rb inspects the team training  he is interested in sequences of moves of length exactly  n   how many different sequences of moves of length  n  are there  two
