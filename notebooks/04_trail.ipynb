decided to paint each image in exactly one color of the possible k colors from his palette however he really likes colorful things he chose n numbers f i and decided to paint the image numbered i differently than the image numbered f i except when f i = i if f i = i that means he can paint the image numbered f i whichever color he likes as long as all other conditions have been met mirko wants

of an n times n grid divided up into various non overlapping sections where each section is labeled with an integer target value and an arithmetic operator the object is to fill in the entire grid with the numbers in the range  num  to n such that no number appears more than once in any row or column in each section you must be able to reach the sections target using the numbers in the section and the sections arithmetic operator for this problem we are only interested in single sections of a   puzzle not the entire puzzle two examples of sections from an  num  times  num    puzzle are shown below along with some of their possible assignments of digits note that while sections labeled with a subtraction or division operator can consist of only two grid squares those labeled with addition or multiplication can have any number also note that in a  num  times  num  puzzle the first example would have two more solutions each involving the numbers  num  and  num  finally note that in the first solution of the second section you could not swap the  num  and  num  in the first row since that would result in two  num  s in the same column you may be wondering for a given size   puzzle and a given section in the puzzle how many valid ways are there to fill in the section well stop wondering and start programming the input will start with a single line of the form n m t op where n is the size of the   puzzle containing the section to be described m is the number of grid squares in the section t is the target value and op is either + - * or indicating the arithmetic operator to use for the section output the number of valid ways in which the section could be filled in for a   puzzle of the given size\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n
