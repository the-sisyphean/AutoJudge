Hiding an animal\\n    of this size is difficult: if you use a lot of space, it is\\n    obvious that you are hiding something from your friends. Hence,\\n    you want to use as little space as possible to hide the\\n    kangaroo.\\nWhen the kangaroo was placed against the wall, you took a\\n    black and white picture of the animal. Looking around in the\\n    house, the only tools you found to hide the kangaroo with were\\n    empty tin cans. The dimensions of the tin cans correspond with\\n    $2 \\\\times 2$ pixels in the\\n    picture and these cans cannot overlap. So, you can make a\\n    cangaroo and if someone asks why you have cans in the\\n    shape of a kangaroo, you simply say it is a bad joke of\\n    yours.\\nThe position of each can has to exactly correspond to a\\n    block of $2\\\\times 2$\\n    pixels in the picture, and they cannot be shifted or rotated to\\n    only partially cover some pixels. Furthermore, cans cannot\\n    float in the air, so every can has to be supported either by\\n    the floor, which is just below the bottom row of the picture,\\n    or by another can, for which at least one of the left and right\\n    half must directly rest on another can. The structure does not\\n    otherwise need to be balanced.\\nWhat is the minimum number of cans needed to hide the\\n    kangaroo?\\n\",\n          \"You have sent a robot out into the forest, and it has gotten\\n    lost.

You do have a map of all trees in\\n    the forest, represented as $(x,y)$ points. Conveniently, since\\n    this used to be a tree farm, all trees are at integer\\n    coordinates, though not all coordinates are occupied. The\\n    robot\\u2019s sensor tells you the $x$ and $y$ distance to each tree within\\n    range, relative to the front of the robot. However, the robot\\n    is heading in an unknown direction relative to the map, so each\\n    sensor reading is given as a tuple of (distance to the right of\\n    the robot, distance forward of the robot) and either value can\\n    be negative since the robot can sense in all directions.\\n    Helpfully, the robot will always place itself at integer\\n    coordinates and aligned to the positive or negative\\n    $x$ or $y$ axis, and will never be at the\\n    same location as a tree. Can you find out where the robot\\n    is?\\n\",\n          \"Method ringing is used to ring bells in churches,\\n    particularly in England.

Unfortunately, the laws of physics\\n    place a limitation on any two consecutive rows; when a bell is\\n    rung, it has considerable inertia and the ringer has only a\\n    limited ability to accelerate or retard its cycle. Therefore,\\n    the position of each bell can change by at most one between two\\n    consecutive rows.\\nIn Figure\\u00a01, you can see the pattern of a non-ideal\\n    performance, where bells only change position by at most\\n    one.\\nGiven $n$, the number\\n    of bells, output an ideal performance.

These heavy elements are very\\n    unstable and have only been synthesized in a few\\n    laboratories.\\nYou have just been hired by one of these labs to optimize\\n    the algorithms used in simulations. For example, when\\n    simulating complicated chemical reactions, it is important to\\n    keep track of how many particles there are, and this is done by\\n    counting connected components in a graph.\\nCurrently, the lab has some Python code (see attachments)\\n    that takes an undirected graph and outputs the number of\\n    connected components. As you can see, this code is based on\\n    everyone’s favourite data structure union-find1.\\nAfter looking at the code for a while, you notice that it\\n    actually has a bug in it!

It is an easy job\\n    for him since he has a nifty new woodcutting machine that can\\n    take down forests like wildfire. However, Mirko is only allowed\\n    to cut a single row of trees.\\nMirko’s machine works as follows: Mirko sets a height\\n    parameter $H$ (in metres),\\n    and the machine raises a giant sawblade to that height and cuts\\n    off all tree parts higher than $H$ (of course, trees not higher than\\n    $H$ meters remain intact).\\n    Mirko then takes the parts that were cut off. For example, if\\n    the tree row contains trees with heights of $20$, $15$, $10$, and $17$ metres, and Mirko raises his\\n    sawblade to $15$ metres,\\n    the remaining tree heights after cutting will be $15$, $15$, $10$, and $15$ metres, respectively, while Mirko\\n    will take $5$ metres off\\n    the first tree and $2$\\n    metres off the fourth tree ($7$ metres of wood in total).\\nMirko is ecologically minded, so he does not want to cut off\\n    more wood than necessary. That is why he wants to set his\\n    sawblade as high as possible. Help Mirko find the maximum\\n    integer height of the sawblade that still allows him to cut off\\n    at least $M$ metres of\\n    wood.\\n\n","input_description

It is an easy job\\n    for him since he has a nifty new woodcutting machine that can\\n    take down forests like wildfire. However, Mirko is only allowed\\n    to cut a single row of trees.\\nMirko’s machine works as follows: Mirko sets a height\\n    parameter $H$ (in metres),\\n    and the machine raises a giant sawblade to that height and cuts\\n    off all tree parts higher than $H$ (of course, trees not higher than\\n    $H$ meters remain intact).\\n    Mirko then takes the parts that were cut off. For example, if\\n    the tree row contains trees with heights of $20$, $15$, $10$, and $17$ metres, and Mirko raises his\\n    sawblade to $15$ metres,\\n    the remaining tree heights after cutting will be $15$, $15$, $10$, and $15$ metres, respectively, while Mirko\\n    will take $5$ metres off\\n    the first tree and $2$\\n    metres off the fourth tree ($7$ metres of wood in total).\\nMirko is ecologically minded, so he does not want to cut off\\n    more wood than necessary. That is why he wants to set his\\n    sawblade as high as possible. Help Mirko find the maximum\\n    integer height of the sawblade that still allows him to cut off\\n    at least $M$ metres of\\n    wood.\\n</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>input_description</th>\n","      <td>The first line of input contains two space-separated\\n    positive integers, $N$\\n    (the number of trees, $1 \\le N\\n    \\le 1\\, 000\\, 000$) and $M$ (Mirko’s required wood amount,\\n    $1 \\le M \\le 2\\, 000\\, 000\\,\\n    000$).</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>output_description</th>\n","      <td>The first and only line of output must contain the required\\n    height setting.</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>sample_io</th>\n","      <td>[{'input': '4 7\n","20 15 10 17', 'output': '15'}, {'input': '5 20\n","4 42 40 26 46', 'output': '36'}]</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>problem_class</th>\n","      <td>medium</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>problem_score</th>\n","      <td>4.5</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>url</th>\n","      <td>https://open.kattis.com/problems/eko</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","</div><br><label><b>dtype:</b> object</label>"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":11}],"source":["#checking any random row for more ideas to clean\n","row = df.sample(1).index[0]\n","df.loc[row]\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":13,"metadata":{"id":"zzplNOiE5lKw","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1767575960258,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":5,"user":{"displayName":"CHAITHANYA SG","userId":"16455739499272747219"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["#1. we can remove \\cdot _ :"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["So in conclusion:\n","1. there is imabalance, we shall have to balance it.\n","2. the title,sample_io,url does not seem to contribute to guess the difficulty level so they should be removed\n","3. we have to handle the empty strings\n","4. we should keep the numbers and math symbols for sure as they tell how tough a problem could be.\n","5. we can remove () \\n ! , \\cdot _ : ' -\n","6. we can also covert the special characters like ö to normal characters.\n","7. we can lowercase everything.\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"3fJu09STykxd"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"buzoTzjC6hPl"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"provenance":[],"authorship_tag":"ABX9TyOobh1FnoLRDJiQ+OI6/FGO"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
