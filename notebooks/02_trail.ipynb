unununium   was the name of the chemical element with atom number  num  until it changed to rontgenium rg in  num  these heavy elements are very unstable and have only been synthesized in a few laboratories you have just been hired by one of these labs to optimize the algorithms used in simulations for example when simulating complicated chemical reactions it is important to keep track of how many particles there are and this is done by counting connected components in a graph currently the lab has some python code see attachments that takes an undirected graph and outputs the number of connected components as you can see this code is based on everyones favourite data structure union find num  after looking at the code for a while you notice that it actually has a bug in it the code still gives correct answers but the bug could cause it to run inefficiently your task is to construct a graph with a given number of vertices and edges where the code runs very slowly we will count how many times the third line the one inside the while loop is visited and your program will get a score according to this number\n","input_description

name of the chemical element with atom number  num  until it changed to rontgenium rg in  num  these heavy elements are very unstable and have only been synthesized in a few laboratories you have just been hired by one of these labs to optimize the algorithms used in simulations for example when simulating complicated chemical reactions it is important to keep track of how many particles there are and this is done by counting connected components in a graph currently the lab has some python code see attachments that takes an undirected graph and outputs the number of connected components as you can see this code is based on everyones favourite data structure union find num  after looking at the code for a while you notice that it actually has a bug in it the code still gives correct answers but the bug could cause it to run inefficiently your task is to construct a graph with a given number of vertices and edges where the code runs very slowly we will count how many times the third line the one inside the while loop is visited and your program will get a score according to this number\n","input_description

by one of these labs to optimize the algorithms used in simulations for example when simulating complicated chemical reactions it is important to keep track of how many particles there are and this is done by counting connected components in a graph currently the lab has some python code see attachments that takes an undirected graph and outputs the number of connected components as you can see this code is based on everyones favourite data structure union find num  after looking at the code for a while you notice that it actually has a bug in it the code still gives correct answers but the bug could cause it to run inefficiently your task is to construct a graph with a given number of vertices and edges where the code runs very slowly we will count how many times the third line the one inside the while loop is visited and your program will get a score according to this number the input consists of one line with two integers n and m the number of vertices and edges your graph should
