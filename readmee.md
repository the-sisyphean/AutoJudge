AutoJudge: Predicting Programming Problem Difficulty 


Online coding platforms (like Codeforces, Kattis, CodeChef) classify programming problems as Easy, Medium, or Hard, and also assign a difficulty score.
However, this process usually depends on human judgment and user feedback.
In this project, your task is to build an intelligent system that can automatically predict:
Problem Class → Easy / Medium / Hard (classification task)


Problem Score → a numerical difficulty score (regression task)


The prediction should be based only on the textual description of the problem, such as:
Problem description
Input description
Output description
You will use the provided dataset only, which already contains problems with difficulty labels and scores.
Finally, you will build a simple web interface where a user can paste a new problem description and get:
Predicted difficulty class
Predicted difficulty score

Dataset Description → Link (this dataset is just for reference you can use some other as well)
Each data sample contains:
title
description
input_description
output_description
problem_class → (Easy / Medium / Hard)
problem_score → (numerical value)
You do not need to create or label the dataset yourself.

Project Objectives
By the end of this project, your system should:
Predict problem difficulty class
Predict problem difficulty score
Work using only textual information
Provide results through a simple web UI

Expected Deliverables
Data Preprocessing


Clean and combine text fields
Handle missing values if any


Feature Extraction
Convert text into numerical features



Model 1: Classification
Predict problem_class (Easy / Medium / Hard)


Model 2: Regression
Predict problem_score


Evaluation
Classification: accuracy / confusion matrix
Regression: MAE / RMSE


Web Interface
Text boxes for:
Problem description
Input description
Output description


Display predicted class and score


Documentation
Clear README explaining approach and results



Hints (To Help You Get Started)
🔹 Feature Engineering (Important!)
Combine all text fields into one single text input
Useful features:
Text length
Number of mathematical symbols
Keyword frequency (e.g., graph, dp, recursion)
TF-IDF vectors


🔹 Models to Try (Simple & Effective)
Classification
Logistic Regression
Random Forest
Support Vector Machine (SVM)


Regression
Linear Regression
Random Forest Regressor
Gradient Boosting
You are not required to use deep learning.

🌐 Web UI Expectations (Simple)
The UI should allow a user to:
Paste:
Problem description
Input description
Output description


Click Predict


See:
Predicted difficulty class
Predicted difficulty score
No authentication or database required.
